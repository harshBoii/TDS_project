      "text": "# Tools in Data Science - May 2025 [Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches popular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production. This course exposes you to real-life tools Courses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them? These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school: - You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself. - You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace. - You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes. [![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/) In this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science. Learn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers. This course is quite hard Here's students' feedback: - [2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268) - It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.

It'll be too tough for you now. But it's probably worth it. Here's students' feedback: - [Course experience and farewell post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/course-experience-and-farewell-post/173247) Programming skills are a pre-requisite You need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts. **But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process. In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself. This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them. If you passed, don't enroll again The course is public, so you can always audit it. Also, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625). We encourage learning by sharing You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well. **To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize. **To learn better, teach** what you've learnt. ## We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks The content evolves with technology and feedback.

Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now. - **Remote exams are open and hard** - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets... - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2) - **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy. - **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context. - **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks) - **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations. - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks. ## Constantly check communications Check these three links regularly to keep up with the course. 1. **[Seek Notifications](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** for Course Notifications.

And to get the data set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module. How do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module. - The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them? - The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured. - Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find? This will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet or within your organization or even within your phones. ## Sources of Data [![Sources of Data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GY5l_5RpVZM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM) - [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) - [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) - [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/) - [Data.gov](https://data.gov/)",

Both of these are powerful skills. The more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to. Therefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building. The other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with. Structured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work. You don't have to extract information from it. Numerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure. So you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort. ## Sample questions - Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01) - What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: ) - Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured. They have author names, abstracts, keywords, etc. but most content is free-form.) - Are book titles categorical or composite? (ANS: Categorical. They don't have an underlying structure.) ## Optional: Tools used in the industry Kathir Mani from QueLit and Anand S from Gramener discuss the tools and technologies used in the industry.

      "text": "# Base 64 Encoding Base64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats. Watch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min): [![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY) Here's how it works: - It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters - ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4) - There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs - Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ```python import base64 # Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" # Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! # Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() # Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\" ``` Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI: ```html ``` Base64 is used in many places: - JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads - Email: MIME attachments encoding - Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers - JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication - SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format - SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO - Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: - [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding - [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs",

      "text": "## Converting HTML to Markdown When working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example: - **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing - **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content - **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption - **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms - **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization - **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats - **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line. ### defuddle-cli [defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. ```bash find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\; ``` - `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found - `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting - `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown - `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension ### Pandoc [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors. [![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40) ```bash find . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\; ``` - `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found - `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion - `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown - `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument ### Lynx [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files. ```bash find . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} + ``` - `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency - `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch - `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end - `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name ### w3m [w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial. ```bash find . -type f -name '*.html' \\ -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\ w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\ done' _ {} + ``` - `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories - `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency - `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch - `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames - `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name ### Comparison | Approach | Speed | Format Quality | Preservation | Best For | | ------------ |",

Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text. ```bash uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install crawl4ai crawl4ai-setup ``` - `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv) - `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax) - `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package - `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies ### markdown-crawler [markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting. ```bash uv venv source .venv/bin/activate.fish uv pip install markdown-crawler markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ``` - `uv venv` and activation: Same as above - `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package - `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options: - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels - `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory - Final argument is the starting URL",

      "text": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown PDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs). Use Cases: - **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training - **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents - **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication - **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis - **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers - **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers - **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation ### PyMuPDF4LLM [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities. PyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures. ```bash PYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))' ``` - `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale - `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package - `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line - `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module - `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output - `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file ## Markitdown [![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg) [Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents. ```bash PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md ``` - `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding - `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager - `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file - `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file ### Unstructured [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained. ## GROBID If you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy. ```bash # Start GROBID service docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2 # Process PDF with curl curl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml ``` ### Mistral OCR API [Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing. ## Azure Document Intelligence API For enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities. ### Other libraries [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction. [MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies. ## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools | Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For | | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | | PyMuPDF4LLM | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch | AI training data, semantic structure | | Markitdown | Multi-format support, simple usage | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents | | Unstructured | Wide format support, active development | Can be resource-intensive | Production pipelines, integration | | GROBID | Reference extraction excellence | Narrower use case | Academic papers, citations | | Docling | Advanced document understanding | Installation difficulties | Research applications | | MegaParse | Comprehensive approach | Requires OpenAI API |",

      "text": "## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain. Watch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min): [![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0) Key CORS concepts: - **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default - **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests - **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed - **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication If you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Here are other common CORS headers: ```http Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true ``` To implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/): ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins # Or, provide more granular control: app.add_middleware( CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"], # Allow a specific domain allow_credentials=True, # Allow cookies allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"], # Allow specific methods allow_headers=[\"*\"], # Allow all headers ) ``` Testing CORS with JavaScript: ```javascript // Simple request const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", { method: \"GET\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); // Request with credentials const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", { credentials: \"include\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); ``` Useful CORS debugging tools: - [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations - Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests - [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development Common CORS errors and solutions: - `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers - `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` - `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` - `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins",

      "text": "## Crawling with the CLI Since websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline. Web crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios: - **Data mining and analysis**: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research - **Content archiving**: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes - **SEO analysis**: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings - **Legal compliance**: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation - **Website migration**: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design - **Offline access**: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection The most commonly used tool for fetching websites is [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install. [![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo) To crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) for example, you could run: ```bash wget \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ``` Here's what each option does: - `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links) - `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL - `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory - `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally - `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types - `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate) - `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions - `--directory-prefix=./ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory [wget2](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same. ```bash wget2 \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ``` There are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget: ### Wpull [Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration. ```bash uvx wpull \\ --recursive \\ --level=3 \\ --no-parent \\ --convert-links \\ --adjust-extension \\ --compression=auto \\ --accept html,htm \\ --directory-prefix=./ds \\ https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/ ``` ### HTTrack [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options. ```bash httrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\ -O \"./ds\" \\ \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\ -r3 ``` ### Robots.txt `robots.txt` is a standard file found in a website's root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It's part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling. **Why it's important**: - **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers - **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed - **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners' rights to control access to their content - **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators' wishes **How to override robots.txt restrictions**: - **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off` - **httrack**: Use `-s0` - **wpull**: Use `--no-robots` **When to override robots.txt (use with discretion)**: Only bypass `robots.txt` when: - You have explicit permission from the website owner - You're crawling your own website - The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won't cause server issues - You're conducting authorized security testing Remember that bypassing `robots.txt` without legitimate reason may: - Violate terms of service - Lead to IP banning - Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions - Cause reputation damage to your organization Always use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.",

And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. 1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data. 2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.

Docker is the industry standard. Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way. Initialize the container engine: ```bash podman machine init podman machine start ``` Common Operations. (You can use `docker` instead of `podman` in the same way.) ```bash # Pull an image podman pull python:3.11-slim # Run a container podman run -it python:3.11-slim # List containers podman ps -a # Stop container podman stop container_id # Scan image for vulnerabilities podman scan myapp:latest # Remove container podman rm container_id # Remove all stopped containers podman container prune ``` You can create a `Dockerfile` to build a container image. Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image. ```dockerfile FROM python:3.11-slim # Set working directory WORKDIR /app # Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine, # but here we're just using a simple script. RUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py # Run the script CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"] ``` To build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands: ```bash # Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login podman login docker.io # Build and run the container podman build -t py-hello . podman run -it py-hello # Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username. podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello # Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG ``` Tools: - [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): Explore image layers - [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo): Work with container images - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Security scanner [![Podman Tutorial Zero to Hero | Full 1 Hour Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YXfA5O5Mr18/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/YXfA5O5Mr18) [![Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gAkwW2tuIqE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/gAkwW2tuIqE) - Optional: For Windows, see [WSL 2 with Docker getting started](https://youtu.be/5RQbdMn04Oc)",

      "text": "## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models Embedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: 1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | | **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider | | **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go | | **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high | The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: 1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. ### Local Embeddings [![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o) Here's a minimal example using a local embedding model: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \"==3.12\" # dependencies = [ # \"sentence-transformers\", # \"httpx\", # \"numpy\", # ] # /// from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer import numpy as np model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5') # A small, high quality model async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\" return model.encode(text).tolist() async def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float: \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\" emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1)) emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2)) return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2))) async def main(): print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\")) print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\")) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import asyncio asyncio.run(main()) ``` Note the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings. ### OpenAI Embeddings For comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script: ```python import os import httpx async def embed(text: str) -> list[float]: \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\" async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"}, json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text} ) return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"] ``` **NOTE**: You need to set the [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable for this to work.",

You can install it via: - `pip install faster-whisper` - [Download Windows Standalone](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases) Here's a basic usage example: ```bash faster-whisper-xxl \"video.mp4\" --model medium --language en ``` Here's my recommendation for transcribing videos. This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory. ```bash faster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\ --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\ --model medium --language en $FILE ``` - `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from: - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate - `base`: Good for simple audio - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy - `medium`: Recommended default - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest - `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from: - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc. - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example. - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format. - `txt`: Just the text transcript - `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is - `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it. Run `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options. ## Gemini transcription The [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways: 1.

They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. 2. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: 1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. 1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4. Run this code: ```bash curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\ -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"$(cat << EOF { \"contents\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"parts\": [ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\", \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\" } }, {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"} ] } ] } EOF )\" ```",

This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) -- a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. [![OpenAI Function Calling - Full Beginner Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aqdWSYWC_LI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/aqdWSYWC_LI) Here's a minimal example using Python and OpenAI's function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"httpx\", # ] # /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if __name__ == \"__main__\": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]]) ``` ### How to define functions The function definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). Here's an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting: ```python MEETING_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\" }, \"time\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\" }, \"meeting_room\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\" } }, \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ``` ### How to define multiple functions You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter. Here's an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses: ```python tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\", \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\", \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" }, \"current_year\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ] ``` Best Practices: 1. **Use Strict Mode** - Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls - Define all required parameters - Set `additionalProperties: False` 2. **Use tool choice** - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate 3. **Clear Descriptions** - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions - Include expected formats and units - Mention any constraints or limitations 4. **Error Handling** - Validate function inputs before execution - Return clear error messages - Handle missing or invalid parameters",

[![🔥 Python FastAPI Google Login Tutorial | OAuth2 Authentication (19 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4ExQYRCwbzw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4ExQYRCwbzw) Google Auth is the most commonly implemented single sign-on mechanism because: - It's popular and user-friendly. Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. - It's secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here's how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. 1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console – Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**. 2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`). 3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `.env` file: ```env GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret ``` 4. Create your FastAPI `app.py`: ```python # /// script # dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] # /// import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\") oauth = OAuth() oauth.register( name=\"google\", client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"), client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"), server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\", client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, ) @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request): user = request.session.get(\"user\") # 3. For authenticated users: say hello if user: return f\"Hello {user['email']}\" # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session if \"code\" in request.query_params: token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request) request.session[\"user\"] = token[\"userinfo\"] return RedirectResponse(\"/\") # 1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login return await oauth.google.authorize_redirect(request, request.url) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, port=8000) ``` Now, run `uv run app.py`. 1. When you visit you'll be redirected to a Google login page. 2. When you log in, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Now you'll see the email ID you logged in with. Instead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example: - Allow access to specfic users and not others - Fetch the user's personalized information - Display different content based on the user",

      "text": "## Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense Hybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. ### Install and run TypeSense [Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html). ```bash mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108:8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key=secret-key \\ --enable-cors ``` - **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port. - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence. - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume. - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API. - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests. **Expected output:** - Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`. - Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`. ### Embed and import documents into TypeSense Follow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli.md) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line. [TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability. Save the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`. ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.13\" # dependencies = [\"httpx\"] # /// import json import httpx import os headers = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"} schema = { \"name\": \"notes\", \"fields\": [ {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False}, { \"name\": \"embedding\", \"type\": \"float[]\", \"embed\": { \"from\": [\"content\"], \"model_config\": { \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\", \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"), }, }, }, ], } with open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f: chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()] with httpx.Client() as client: # Create the collection if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404: r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers) # Embed the chunks result = client.post( \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\", headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"}, data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks), ) print(result.text) ``` - **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python. - **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI. - **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document. - **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence. - **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection. - **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly. **Expected output:** - A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported. - (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.) ### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question Now, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search): ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" payload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\ '{ searches: [ { collection: $coll, q: $q, query_by: \"content,embedding\", sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\", prefix: false, exclude_fields: \"embedding\" } ] }' ) curl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\ -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\ -d \"$payload\" \\ | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\ | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\ | uvx streamdown ``` - **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity. - **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits. - **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight. - **`curl -d`**: posts the search request. - **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit’s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) - **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer. **Expected output:** - The raw matched snippets printed first. - Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.",

      "text": "## Images: Compression Image compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time. Here are things you should know when you're compressing images: - **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot - **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data - **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files - **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss - **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless Here's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025. - Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one) - Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP Common operations with Python: ```python from pathlib import Path from PIL import Image import io async def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None: \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\" with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed if img.mode == 'RGBA': img = img.convert('RGB') # Optimize for web img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True) # Batch process images paths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg') for p in paths: await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp')) ``` Command line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/). ```bash # Convert to WebP cwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp # Optimize PNG pngquant --quality=65-80 image.png # Optimize JPEG jpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg # Convert and resize convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg # Batch convert mogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg ``` Watch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min): [![Modern Image Optimization (15 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/F1kYBnY6mwg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg) Tools for image optimization: - [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/): Browser-based compression - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/): GUI tool for Mac - [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/): Node.js image processing - [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): Python imaging library",

Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files. For data scientists, JSON is essential when: - Working with REST APIs and web services - Storing configuration files and metadata - Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB - Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite) Watch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min): [![JSON Crash Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GpOO5iKzOmY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GpOO5iKzOmY) Key concepts to understand in JSON: - JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects - You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects - Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line. It's useful for logging and streaming data.

      "text": "# Large Language Models This module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs). **LLMs incur a cost.** For the May 2025 batch, use [aipipe.org](https://aipipe.org/) as a proxy. Emails with `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` get a **$1 per calendar month** allowance. (Don't exceed that.) Read the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short: 1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...` 2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login) 3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano` For example, let's use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings: ```bash curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\", \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }] }' curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }' ``` Or using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/): ```bash llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1 llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small ``` **For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request. ## AI Proxy - Jan 2025 For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don't exceed that. **Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically: 1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...` 2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you.",

You should be able to see them on YouTube. **Q2: How should I approach TDS?** **A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools. **Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?** **A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules. **Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?** **A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded. **Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?** **A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap. **Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?** **A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up. **Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?** **A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools. **Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?** **A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools. **Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?** **A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this. **Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?** **A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions. **Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?** **A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields. **Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?** **A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other. **Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?** **A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand. **Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?** **A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions. **Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?** **A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment. **Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?** **A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube. **Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?** **A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people. **Q18: What is a \"take-home open internet\" project?** **A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions. **Q19: What weeks are relevant to each project?** **A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics. **Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the",

The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session. **Q2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?** **A2:** The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube. **Q3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?** **A3:** The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question. **Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?** **A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup. **Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?** **A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js. **Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?** **A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission. **Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?** **A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material. **Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?** **A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided. **Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?** **A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments. **Q10: How do we start the project?** **A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project. **Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?** **A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube. **Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?** **A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute). **Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?** **A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser. **Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?** **A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors. **Q15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?** **A15:** The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server. **Q16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?** **A16:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. **Q17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?** **A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files. **Q18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?** **A18:** The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure. **Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?** **A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs). **Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?** **A20:** The",

However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure. **Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?** **A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs). **Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?** **A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. **Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?** **A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable. Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work. **Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?** **A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#). **Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?** **A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array. **Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard. **Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?** **A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option. **Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?** **A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change. **Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?** **A27:** Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element. **Q28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?** **A28:** No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements. **Q29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?** **A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question. **Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?** **A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`. **Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?** **A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears. **Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?** **A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally. **Q33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?** **A33:** npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file. **Q34: While showing `innerText`, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?** **A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability. **Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard. **Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?** **A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun",

Why?** **A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability. **Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?** **A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard. **Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?** **A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them.",

Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed. **Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?** **A2:** Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient. **Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?** **A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question. **Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?** **A4:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles. **Q5: How can I access data from a JSON object?** **A5:** The instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use `students[2][name]`. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values. **Q6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?** **A6:** Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched. **Q7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?** **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using the `requests` library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response. **Q8: What is Postman and how does it work?** **A8:** Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose. **Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?** **A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (`>`) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail. **Q10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?** **A10:** For large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation. **Q11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?** **A11:** When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the `encoding` parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding. **Q12: How to use Git and GitHub?** **A12:** The instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation. **Q13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?** **A13:** The instructor explains how to use the WSL extension in VS Code to access a Linux terminal within VS Code. This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative. **Q14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?** **A14:** The instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students' logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for",

The \"fitting of six models\" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning. **Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?** **A2:** The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos. **Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?** **A3:** The TDS project has three main parts: 1. **GitHub:** For version control and code storage. 2. **Docker Hub:** For containerizing and deploying the application. 3. **LLM (Large Language Model):** For the core functionality of the application. The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details. **Q4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?** **A4:** The course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges. **Q5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?** **A5:** You can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance. **Q6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?** **A6:** Key tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application. **Q7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?** **A7:** VS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface. **Q8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?** **A8:** You can use the `sed` editor with the `-i` option for in-place editing and the `I` flag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with `find` to locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure. **Q9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?** **A9:** You can use the `git remote add origin ` command to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page. **Q10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?** **A10:** If you're using HTTPS, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using `git config`. You might also need to check the permissions granted to your personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication. **Q11: How many students are regularly attending the live sessions?** **A11:** The attendance in the live sessions is lower than expected, with around 15-25 students at peak times, compared to the 400-500 enrolled in the current term. **Q12: What is the new feature added for TDS live sessions?** **A12:** A new feature has been added that curates the live sessions into a few important portions, providing a summary of the questions asked and their answers. This allows students who missed a session to quickly catch up on the key topics discussed. **Q13: When is the next session scheduled, and will it clash with college classes?** **A13:** The next session is scheduled for 5 PM. There might be clashes with college classes, as the schedule is pre-planned with classes on Tuesdays from 5-7 PM, Wednesdays from 9-10 AM, and other classes from 8-10 PM. **Q14: Where can I find the link for the new feature summarizing live sessions?** **A14:**",

The responses are used to plan future sessions. **Q16: What is GitHub, and how is it used in the project?** **A16:** GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. In the project, you will push your code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible to others and enabling collaboration. **Q17: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?** **A17:** Git is a version control system that you install and use on your local machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for remote collaboration and code sharing. **Q18: What are the alternatives to using command-line tools for Git and GitHub operations?** **A18:** You can use a graphical interface like VS Code with Git extensions to manage your Git repositories and interact with GitHub. This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools. **Q19: How does the `sed` editor work for replacing text in files?** **A19:** The `sed` editor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the `s` command for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching. **Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?** **A21:** The `find` command can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the `-exec` option to execute a command, like `sed`, on each file found. For example, `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;` will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace \"IITM\" with \"IIT Madras\" (case-insensitive) in each file. **Q22: Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error when pushing to GitHub?** **A22:** This could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication. **Q23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?** **A23:** You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password. **Q24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?** **A24:** You can generate SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen` command and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token. **Q25: What is the purpose of the `git remote add origin` command?** **A25:** This command adds a remote repository named \"origin\" to your local Git instance. \"Origin\" is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub. **Q26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?** **A26:** You can update the remote URL using the `git remote set-url origin ` command, replacing `` with the correct URL of your GitHub repository. **Q27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?** **A27:** Committing saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub. **Q28: How can I use VS Code to simplify Git operations?** **A28:** VS Code has built-in Git integration and extensions that provide a graphical interface for managing your repository.

The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle. **Q2: What is the tool to create the API?** **A2:** FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session. **Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?** **A3:** Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today. **Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?** **A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time. **Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?** **A5:** You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub. **Q6: What is the tool to create the API?** **A6:** FastAPI. **Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?** **A7:** Whatever you last submitted is your final score. **Q8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?** **A8:** This will be addressed toward the end of the session. **Q9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?** **A9:** Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box. **Q10: What is CI/CD?** **A10:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow. **Q11: What is Vercel?** **A11:** Vercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo. **Q12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?** **A12:** Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos. **Q13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?** **A13:** Yes, that's possible. **Q14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?** **A14:** There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together. **Q15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?** **A15:** Yes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven't changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow.",

Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies. **Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?** **A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools. **Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?** **A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task. **Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?** **A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab. **Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?** **A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging. **Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?** **A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause. **Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?** **A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet. **Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?** **A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email. **Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?** **A9:** There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes. **Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: \"Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original.\" I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?** **A10:** The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared. **Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?** **A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses. **Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?** **A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise. **Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?** **A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository. **Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?** **A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum. **Q15: Question 16 in",

The `diff` command shows the differences between two files directly. `git diff` compares commits in a git repository. **Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?** **A2:** Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot. **Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?** **A3:** I used a bash script that combines the `find` command (to locate files of a specific type, like `.txt` files) and the `mv` command (to move them). The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames. **Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?** **A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries. **Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?** **A5:** First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv `. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). **Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?** **A6:** When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove `debug=True` from your Flask application before deploying to production. **Q7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?** **A7:** ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator. **Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?** **A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify. **Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?** **A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages. **Q10: What is the assignment?** **A10:** Create a Flask application that takes a user's birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder.",

We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session. **Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?** **A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later. **Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?** **A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools. **Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?** **A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM. **Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?** **A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file. **Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?** **A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section. **Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?** **A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it. **Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?** **A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics. **Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?** **A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done. **Q10: What's required for grading?** **A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria: - It must exist and be publicly accessible. - It must have a license file (MIT license). - It must have a valid Dockerfile. - The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command. - The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository. It doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated. **Q11: What is the grading scheme?** **A11:** Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12. **Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?** **A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code. **Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?** **A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code. **Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?** **A14:** All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year.

Use your IITM email address to register. **Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?** **A15:** We'll cover this in a later session. **Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?** **A16:** We'll cover this in a later session. **Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?** **A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow. **Q18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?** **A18:** Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. **Q19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?** **A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts. **Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?** **A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35. **Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?** **A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark. **Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?** **A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet. **Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?** **A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API. **Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?** **A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens. **Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?** **A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work. **Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?** **A26:** No, you don't have to pay. **Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?** **A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due. **Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?** **A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then. **Q29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?** **A29:** Sure. **Q30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say \"yes\"?** **A30:** You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up",

For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35. **Q33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?** **A33:** Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs. **Q34: How do I get my API key?** **A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs. **Q35: What is a proxy?** **A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI. **Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?** **A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage. **Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?** **A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient. **Q38: How are API calls made?** **A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output. **Q39: Can you share the notebook file?** **A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available. **Q40: What about function calling?** **A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate. **Q41: What about embeddings?** **A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session. **Q42: What about text extraction?** **A42:** We'll cover this in a future session. **Q43: What about Base64 encoding?** **A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API. **Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?** **A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session. **Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?** **A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples. **Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.** **A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions,",

How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?** **A1:** You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID. **Q2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?** **A2:** Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic. **Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?** **A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday. **Q4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.** **A4:** That would be great. **Q5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.** **A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks. **Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?** **A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.) **Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?** **A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in `Flask` in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.) **Q8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?** **A8:** Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response. **Q9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)** **A9:** Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session.

(The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.) **Q10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...** **A10:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is. **Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...** **A11:** There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn't give you a problem anymore. **Q12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?** **A12:** The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word `class` itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called `class` (CLASSS) without the underscore. **Q13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?** **A13:** Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add `/api`. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the `requests` module instead of the `curl` command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. **Q14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.** **A14:** Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn't cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it. **Q15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I'm giving the URL, but it's giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I'll show you.",

We'll have to check with Anand. **Q16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it's showing an error.

I don't know how...** **A17:** In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse. **Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything?

In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...** **A19:** It looks like a Cloudflare error. I've noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error. **Q20: Should I install it separately?** **A20:** No, you won't require requirements for it. Vercel is able to run the program without that. **Q21: For Vercel, I will take the example code and try to run it. One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that.** **A21:** You should use the requests module and send a request using headers and all those informations. What you are using is actually OpenAI's own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there.",

There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well. **Q23: Can I get the code for this?** **A23:** He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it. **Q24: I've taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don't submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.** **A24:** Right, right. **Q25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I'm also getting a very similar error. I couldn't follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end. Shall I share my screen?** **A25:** Just before you share your screen, was it giving you a Cloudflare error? (The student describes the error.) You can share your screen. I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error. The instructor then suggests using the directly executable file for ngrok.) **Q26: I tried all this, same issue. I'm getting an error. I think I've tried all this, same issue.** **A26:** The account is limited to one simultaneous session. You've got another session running somewhere. I think that is inside VS WSL. You'll have to stop that. You'll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It's generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for... can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There's a problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself.",

The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?** **A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it. **Q3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.** **A3:** Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one. **Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?** **A4:** Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the `requirements.txt` file. You can use a single-line command in Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment). **Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.** **A5:** Let's try `python -m venv venv` in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library. **Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?** **A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign. **Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.** **A7:** I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API. **Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).** **A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file. **Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?** **A9:** Exactly. That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your `requirements.txt` file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, `uv` is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there. **Q10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.** **A10:** Your server is not running. Run `vercel deploy --prod` again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code. **Q11: I'm using httpx.** **A11:** Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the `requirements.txt` file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code? **Q12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add `/api` to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.** **A12:** That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add `../` before `q` to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy. **Q13: Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy?** **A13:** No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions. **Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?**",

Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions. **Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?** **A14:** No, they are in the `vercel-python/api` directory. **Q15: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name in question 9.** **A15:** `class` is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means. **Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?** **A16:** You need to use lists. Import `List` from the `typing` library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias. **Q17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.** **A17:** You are using `httpx`. You're also using `index.py`. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server. **Q18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.** **A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here. **Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.** **A19:** Can you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added `/api` to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure. **Q20: I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.** **A20:** Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions. **Q21: Show your folder structure.** **A21:** I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`. **Q22: If I use `uv`, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?** **A22:** Yes. **Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?** **A23:** I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git. **Q24: Can we use the query function?** **A24:** Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi. **Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?** **A25:** That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. `values` will return this. **Q26: Question 9: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name.** **A26:** `class` is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name.

I'm not sure about `httpie`. **Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?** **A29:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`. **Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?** **A30:** You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array. **Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?** **A31:** Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face. **Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?** **A32:** I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS. **Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?** **A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\". **Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?** **A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course. **Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.** **A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD. **Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?** **A36:** You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work. **Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?** **A37:** I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle. **Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?** **A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`. **Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?** **A39:** We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only. **Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?** **A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about",

It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the `requests` module. **Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?** **A41:** That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape. **Q42: Does it involve SVD?** **A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion. **Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.** **A43:** You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\". That's how computers store this information.",

We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function. **Q2: What is the first step in the process?** **A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request. **Q3: What is the goal of the program?** **A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders. **Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?** **A4:** The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format. **Q5: What are the predefined functions?** **A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt. **Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?** **A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format. **Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?** **A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application. **Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?** **A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells. **Q9: How is the JSON response handled?** **A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function. **Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?** **A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data. **Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?** **A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application. **Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?** **A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image. **Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?** **A13:** Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail. **Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?** **A14:** The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using `json.loads` to convert strings to JSON objects. **Q15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?** **A15:** The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It's recommended to save your work frequently. **Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?** **A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters. **Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?** **A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation. **Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?** **A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys. **Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application?** **A19:** The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes",

Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step. **Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?** **A2:** That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors. **Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?** **A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions. **Q4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?** **A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function. **Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?** **A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin. **Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?** **A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling. **Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?** **A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL. **Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?** **A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that: - The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function. - The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time). - The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity). - You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`). **Q9: How do I use Docker?** **A9:** Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container. **Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?** **A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients. **Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?** **A11:** The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically.",

I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing \"method not allowed\".** **A1:** When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service. **Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.** **A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client. **Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?** **A3:** Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces `{}`. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button. **Q4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?** **A4:** Yes, you are. Since you don't have a `.env` file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with `return \"hello\"` to test. Restart the server. **Q5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.** **A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests). **Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?** **A6:** Recently. **Q7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?** **A7:** T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T **Q8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?** **A8:** Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy. **Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.** **A9:** Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client. **Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?** **A10:** Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name. **Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.** **A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository. **Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.** **A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python. **Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?** **A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine. **Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?** **A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same. **Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?** **A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost. **Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?** **A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes. **Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?** **A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process. **Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).** **A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming. **Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the",

      "text": "The size and resolution should be the same. **Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?** **A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost. **Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?** **A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes. **Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?** **A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process. **Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).** **A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming. **Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?** **A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas. **Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?** **A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks. **Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.** **A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment. **Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?** **A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters. **Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?** **A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs. **Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?** **A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure. **Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?** **A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call. **Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?** **A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL. **Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?** **A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM. **Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?** **A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module. **Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?** **A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later. **Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?** **A30:** You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify. **Q31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?** **A31:** Officially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning. **Q32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say \"yes\"?** **A32:** That's something you'll need to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.",

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones. **Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?** **A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel. **Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?** **A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube. **Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?** **A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python). **Q5: How does the `IMPORTHTML` function automatically find the table?** **A5:** It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly. **Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?** **A6:** There are three ways: - **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly. - **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID. - **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data. **Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?** **A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element. **Q8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".** **A8:** When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost). **Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?** **A9:** The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting.",

However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease. **Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?** **A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video. **Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?** **A3:** First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint. **Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?** **A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key. **Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?** **A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this. **Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?** **A6:** Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States). **Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?** **A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser. **Q8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?** **A8:** If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values. **Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?** **A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method. **Q10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?** **A10:** Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages. **Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?** **A11:** Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it's more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame. **Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?** **A12:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g., `span` elements with a specific class) and extract the text content. The instructor also shows how to convert string prices to numerical values. The instructor notes that the order of elements is preserved when using Beautiful Soup, ensuring that data is correctly associated.",

      "text": "## LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act LLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. [![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c) ### What Makes an Agent? An LLM agent consists of three core components: 1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next 2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) 3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: - Observe the environment - Think about what to do - Take action using tools - Observe results - Repeat until task completion ### Command-Line Agent Example We've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that: 1. Takes a task description from the command line 2. Generates code to accomplish the task 3. Automatically extracts and executes the code 4. Passes the results back to the LLM 5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here's how it works: ```bash uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\" ``` The agent will: 1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes 2. Execute the script in a subprocess 3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr) 4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation 5. Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: 1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script 2. Code extraction from the LLM response 3. Code execution in a subprocess 4. Result interpretation by the LLM 5. Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: - Planning (generating code) - Execution (running the code) - Reflection (interpreting results) - Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) ### Agent Architectures Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: 1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions 2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning 3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules 4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps ### Real-World Applications LLM agents can be applied to various domains: 1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information 2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code 3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data 4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions 5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks ### Project Ideas Here are some practical agent projects you could build: 1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts 2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses 3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities 4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation 5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work ### Best Practices 1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations 2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable 3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures 4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency 5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent ### Limitations and Challenges Current LLM agents face several challenges: 1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls 2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities 3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead 4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks 5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management",

[![Language models on the command-line w/ Simon Willison](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/QUXQNi6jQ30/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/QUXQNi6jQ30?t=100) ### Basic Usage [Install llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm#installation). Then set up your [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable. See [Getting started](https://github.com/simonw/llm?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). **TDS Students**: See [Large Language Models](large-language-models.md) for instructions on how to get and use `OPENAI_API_KEY`. ```bash # Run a simple prompt llm 'five great names for a pet pelican' # Continue a conversation llm -c 'now do walruses' # Start a memory-aware chat session llm chat # Specify a model llm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Summarize tomorrow’s meeting agenda' # Extract JSON output llm 'List the top 5 Python viz libraries with descriptions' \\ --schema-multi 'name,description' ``` Or use llm without installation using [`uvx`](uv.md): ```bash # Run llm via uvx without any prior installation uvx llm 'Translate \"Hello, world\" into Japanese' # Specify a model uvx llm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Draft a 200-word blog post on data ethics' # Use structured JSON output uvx llm 'List the top 5 programming languages in 2025 with their release years' \\ --schema-multi 'rank,language,release_year' ``` ### Key Features - **Interactive prompts**: `llm '…'` — Fast shell access to any LLM. - **Conversational flow**: `-c '…'` — Continue context across prompts. - **Model switching**: `-m MODEL` — Use OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and more. - **Structured output**: `llm json` — Produce JSON for automation. - **Logging & history**: `llm logs path` — Persist every prompt/response in SQLite. - **Web UI**: `datasette \"$(llm logs path)\"` — Browse your entire history with Datasette. - **Persistent chat**: `llm chat` — Keep the model in memory across multiple interactions. - **Plugin ecosystem**: `llm install PLUGIN` — Add support for new models, data sources, or workflows. ([Language models on the command-line - Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) ### Practical Uses - **Automated coding**. Generate code scaffolding, review helpers, or utilities on demand. For example, after running`llm install llm-cmd`, run `llm cmd 'Undo the last git commit'`. Inspired by [Simon’s post on using LLMs for rapid tool building](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/). - **Transcript processing**. Summarize YouTube or podcast transcripts using Gemini. See [Putting Gemini 2.5 Pro through its paces](https://www.macstories.net/mac/llm-youtube-transcripts-with-claude-and-gemini-in-shortcuts/). - **Commit messages**. Turn diffs into descriptive commit messages, e.g. `git diff | llm 'Write a concise git commit message explaining these changes'`. \\ - **Data extraction**. Convert free-text into structured JSON for automation. [Structured data extraction from unstructured content using LLM schemas](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/).",

It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet. Marimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working. It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps. Common Operations: ```python # Create new notebook uvx marimo new # Run notebook server uvx marimo edit notebook.py # Export to HTML uvx marimo export notebook.py ``` Best Practices: 1. **Cell Dependencies** - Keep cells focused and atomic - Use clear variable names - Document data flow between cells 2. **Interactive Elements** ```python # Add interactive widgets slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100) # Create dynamic Markdown mo.md(f\"{slider} {\"🟢\" * slider.value}\") ``` 3. **Version Control** - Keep notebooks are Python files - Use Git to track changes - Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration [![\"marimo: an open-source reactive notebook for Python\" - Akshay Agrawal (Nbpy2024)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9R2cQygaoxQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/9R2cQygaoxQ)",

      "text": "## Parsing JSON JSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. [![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g) This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON... | Why | | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | | [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing | | [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax | | [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently | | [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data | | [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data | | [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory | **Examples:** - Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. - Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. - Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal. Practice with these resources: - [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries - [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing - [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions ### Command-line JSON Processing with jq [jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines. **Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process. ```bash # Extract specific fields from JSONL cat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}' # Transform JSON structure cat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}' # Filter and aggregate cat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' ``` ### JMESPath Queries [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions. **Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service. ```python import jmespath # Example queries data = { \"locations\": [ {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}}, {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}} ] } # Find all cities with population > 700000 cities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data) ``` ### Streaming with ijson Loading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data. **Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly. ```python import ijson async def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list: \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\" results = [] with open(filepath, 'rb') as file: # Stream objects under the 'items' key parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item') async for item in parser: if item['value'] > 100: # Process conditionally results.append(item) return results ``` ### Pandas JSON Columns [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations. **Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns. ```python import pandas as pd # Parse JSON strings in a column df = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']}) df['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize) # Normalize nested JSON columns df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') df_normalized = pd.json_normalize( df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads), record_path=['items'], # List of nested objects to unpack meta=['id', 'timestamp'] # Keep these columns from parent ) ``` ### SQL JSON Functions [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html). This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns. **Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries. ```sql SELECT json_extract(data, '$.name') as name, json_extract(data, '$.details.age')",

Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data. **Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics. ```sql SELECT json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name, avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value FROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl') GROUP BY 1 HAVING avg_value > 100 ```",

      "text": "# Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent This project is due on 16 Feb 2025 EoD IST. Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025. For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277). ## Background You have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. Due to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks. Your assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results. ## Create an API Write an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints: - **POST `/run?task=`** Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output. - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases - **GET `/read?path=`** Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output. - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body ## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks The DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated: - **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.) - **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place - **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json` - **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first - **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`) - **A7**. `/data/email.txt` contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt` - **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt` - **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line - **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` Developers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above. For example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent. - The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` - Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt` - `/data/contents.log` में कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो - `/data/contents.log`ல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை `/data/contents.dates`ல எழுது Your task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps. ## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks The DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that: - **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it - **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it",

Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it The DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this: - **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it - **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit - **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database - **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website - **B7**. Compress or resize an image - **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML - **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data Your agent must handle these tasks as well. The business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list. ## Deliverables - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files. - Commit and push your code - Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) that builds your application - Publish your Docker image _publicly_ to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Ensure that running your image via `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...` - [Submit in this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`) Note: - **Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable**. DON'T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script. Use `os.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]` as the token in your script. - **Use your AI Proxy token**. Your [AI Proxy token](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.) - **Stick to GPT-4o-Mini**. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says \"LLM\", it means GPT-4o-Mini. - **Keep your prompts short and concise**. Each call to `/run` and `/read` must complete within 20 seconds. ## Evaluation This [evaluation script](project-1/evaluate.py) evaluates the scripts.Here's how will evaluate a task, e.g. **Task A2**. 1. Call `POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2`. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200. - Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same. 2. Call `GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` and get the revised file contents. 3. Verify that the response was formatted using `prettier@3.4.2`.

For questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029). ## Background You are a clever student who has joined IIT Madras' Online Degree in Data Science. You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) course. To make your life easier, you have decided to build an LLM-based application that can automatically answer any of the graded assignment questions. Specifically, you are building and deploying an API that accepts any question from one of these 5 graded assignments: - [Graded Assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) - [Graded Assignment 2](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga2) - [Graded Assignment 3](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3) - [Graded Assignment 4](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga4) - [Graded Assignment 5](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga5) ... and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment. ## Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data. For example, here's how anyone can make a request: ```bash curl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\ -F \"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the CSV file?\" \\ -F \"file=@abcd.zip\" ``` The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example: ```json { \"answer\": \"1234567890\" } ``` ## Deploy your application Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel. (If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.) ## Share your code - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Commit and push your code ## Submit your URL Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL in this Google Form: . ## Evaluation - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license - We will send 5 questions _randomly_ chosen from the graded assignments above. Correct answers will be awarded 4 marks each. - Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.",

You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) course. Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on: - [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. - [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. ## Scrape the data To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. ## Create an API Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON. For example, here's how anyone can make a request: ```bash curl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\" ``` This is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp): ![Screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp) The response must be a JSON object like this: ```json { \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\", \"links\": [ { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\", \"text\": \"Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.\" }, { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\", \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\" } ] } ``` The response must be sent within 30 seconds. ## Evaluate your application Here are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\"). These are **indicative**. The actual evaluation could ask _any_ realistic student question. To run this: 1. Edit [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") to replace `providers[0].config.url` with your API URL. 2. Run this script: ```bash npx -y promptfoo eval --config project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml ``` ## Deploy your application Deploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform. (If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.) ## Share your code - [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) - [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) - Commit and push your code ## Submit your URL Submit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL at https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-project-virtual-ta ## Evaluation - **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license in the root folder - We will use a modified version of [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\") with 10 realistic questions. Correct answers will be awarded up to 2 marks each. - Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get. Bonus: - 1 mark if your GitHub repo includes a script that scrapes the Discourse posts across a date range from a Discourse course page like [TDS](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) - 2 marks if we deploy your solution (with minimal modifications) as an official solution for students to use.",

      "text": "## Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs). One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: - [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/) - [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design) - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) Here are some best practices: ### Use prompt optimizers They rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore: - [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver) - [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) - [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing) ### Be clear, direct, and detailed Be explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. - **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) - **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) > When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. > The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. > For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. > Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions) ### Give examples Provide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) - **GOOD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_ 1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._ 2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._ _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) > Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ > Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow. [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting) | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples) | [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples) ### Think step by step Instruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers. - **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.) - **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.) > Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. > That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. > Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. > For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.

This provides context and helps tailor the response style. - **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.) - **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) > Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. > By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. > Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

This helps the model understand structure and requirements. - **BAD**: _Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) - **GOOD**: ```xml Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter). ``` (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.) > Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. > They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.

This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. - **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) - **GOOD**: ````markdown Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: ```json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] ``` ```` (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema. > Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. > JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. > Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. > For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. > That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use. ### Prefer Yes/No answers Convert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. - **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) - **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.) > Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five...’. Models are not good with numbers. > They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. > So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no. ### Ask for reason first, then the answer Instruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. - **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) - **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) > BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking.

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" # Answer: fat arrow Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" # Answer: node.getChildren() Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\" # Answer: trivia Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" # Answer: !! ``` You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source. ### 1. Clone the repository ```bash git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book cd typescript-book ``` - `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size. - `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder. You'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo. ### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks ```bash ( shopt -s globstar for f in **/*.md; do uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\ | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\ | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" ' split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:] | to_entries | map({ id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)), content: .value })[] ' done ) | tee chunks.json ``` - `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html) - `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks: - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT‑4o token limits - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk - `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker - `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual) - `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON - `-R`: read raw input - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string - `-c`: compact JSON output - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex` - `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout. You'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line. ### 3. Generate embeddings ```bash llm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json ``` - `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`. - `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage. - `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model. - `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend. - `--format nl`: input is newline‑delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi) This stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`. ```bash llm collections path # shows where the collections are stored llm collections delete typescript-book # deletes the typescript-book collection ``` ### 4. Find similar topics ```bash llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" ``` This returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed. - `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store. - `-n 3`: return three results. - `-c`: the user’s query string. ### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context ```bash Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" llm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\ | jq '.content' \\ | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\ | uvx streamdown ``` This answers the question in natural language following these steps: 1. Store the query in `Q`. 2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks. 3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets. 4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model: - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM. - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded. 5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.",

They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange. Watch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min): [![REST API Crash Course - Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial (52)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qbLc5a9jdXo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo) Key Concepts: 1. **HTTP Methods** - `GET`: Retrieve data - `POST`: Create new data - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data - `DELETE`: Remove data 2. **Status Codes** - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created) - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error) Here's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server.py` script via `uv run server.py`: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.13\" # dependencies = [ # \"fastapi\", # \"uvicorn\", # ] # /// from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException from typing import Dict, List app = FastAPI() # Create a list of items that will act like a database items: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = [] # Create a GET endpoint that returns all items @app.get(\"/items\") async def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]: return items # Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID @app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\") async def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None): return item raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\") # Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item @app.post(\"/items\") async def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]: new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])} items.append(new_item) return new_item if __name__ == \"__main__\": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000) ``` Test the API with curl: ```bash # Get all items curl http://localhost:8000/items # Create an item curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}' # Get specific item curl http://localhost:8000/items/1 ``` Best Practices: 1. **Use Nouns for Resources** - Good: `/users`, `/posts` - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost` 2. **Version Your API** ``` /api/v1/users /api/v2/users ``` 3. **Handle Errors Consistently** ```python { \"error\": \"Not Found\", \"message\": \"User 123 not found\", \"status_code\": 404 } ``` 4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering** ``` /api/posts?status=published&category=tech ``` 5. **Implement Pagination** ``` /api/posts?page=2&limit=10 ``` Tools: - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing and documentation - [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/): API documentation - [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/): Modern command-line HTTP client - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): API request/response validation Learn more about REST APIs: - [REST API Design Best Practices](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/) - [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines) - [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design)",

      "text": "## Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions GitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows. ### Key Concepts - **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times - **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml` - **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository - **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing - **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests Here's a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml: ```python import json import httpx from datetime import datetime, UTC from lxml import html from typing import List, Dict def scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]: \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml. Returns: List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating. \"\"\" headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"} response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers) response.raise_for_status() tree = html.fromstring(response.text) movies = [] for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"): title = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\") else None ) year = ( item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\") else None ) rating = ( item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content() if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\") else None ) if title and year and rating: movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating}) return movies # Scrape data and save with timestamp now = datetime.now(UTC) with open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f: f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\") ``` Here's a sample `.github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data: ```yaml name: Scrape IMDb Top 250 on: schedule: # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day - cron: \"0 0 * * *\" workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers jobs: scrape-imdb: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: contents: write steps: - name: Checkout repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Install uv uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5 - name: Run scraper run: | # python uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py - name: Commit and push changes run: | git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\" git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\" git add *.json git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0 git push ``` ### Best Practices 1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub's caching to speed up package installation 2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging 3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers 4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving 5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures ### Tools and Resources - [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/): Async HTTP client - [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) - [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) ### Video Tutorials [![How to run Github Actions on a Schedule](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eJG86J200nM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)",

PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful. Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min): [![SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8) [![SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk) There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later. Core Concepts: ```sql -- Create a table CREATE TABLE users ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE, created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ); -- Insert data INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'), ('Bob', 'bob@example.com'); -- Query data SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users GROUP BY name HAVING count > 1; -- Join tables SELECT u.name, o.product FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id WHERE o.status = 'pending'; ``` Python Integration: ```python import sqlite3 from pathlib import Path import pandas as pd async def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame: \"\"\"Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame. Args: db_path: Path to SQLite database query: SQL query to execute Returns: DataFrame with query results \"\"\" try: conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path) return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn) finally: conn.close() # Example usage db = Path('data.db') df = await query_database(db, ''' SELECT date, COUNT(*) as count FROM events GROUP BY date ''') ``` Common Operations: 1. **Database Management** ```sql -- Backup database .backup 'backup.db' -- Import CSV .mode csv .import data.csv table_name -- Export results .headers on .mode csv .output results.csv SELECT * FROM table; ``` 2. **Performance Optimization** ```sql -- Create index CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email); -- Analyze query EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com'; -- Show indexes SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index'; ``` 3. **Data Analysis** ```sql -- Time series aggregation SELECT date(timestamp), COUNT(*) as events, AVG(duration) as avg_duration FROM events GROUP BY date(timestamp); -- Window functions SELECT *, AVG(amount) OVER ( PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) as moving_avg FROM transactions; ``` Tools to work with SQLite: - [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/): Lightweight GUI - [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/): Full-featured GUI - [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/): CLI tool - [Datasette](https://datasette.io/): Web interface",

It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters. Here's a minimal example showing common operations: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [\"Pillow\"] # /// from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter async def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Process an image with basic enhancements.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility img = img.convert('RGB') # Resize maintaining aspect ratio img.thumbnail((800, 800)) # Apply enhancements img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img) .enhance(1.2)) return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN) if __name__ == \"__main__\": import asyncio img = asyncio.run(process_image(\"input.jpg\")) img.save(\"output.jpg\", quality=85) ``` Key features and techniques you'll learn: - **Image Loading and Saving**: Handle various formats with automatic conversion - **Basic Operations**: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images - **Color Manipulation**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance - **Filters and Effects**: Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects - **Drawing**: Add text, shapes, and overlays to images - **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images efficiently - **Memory Management**: Process large images without memory issues ### Basic Image Operations Common operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images: ```python from PIL import Image async def transform_image( path: str, size: tuple[int, int], rotation: float = 0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Transform image with basic operations.\"\"\" with Image.open(path) as img: # Resize with anti-aliasing img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS) # Rotate around center if rotation: img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True) # Auto-crop empty edges img = img.crop(img.getbbox()) return img ``` ### Color and Enhancement Adjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools: ```python from PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps async def enhance_image( img: Image.Image, brightness: float = 1.0, contrast: float = 1.0, saturation: float = 1.0 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply color enhancements to image.\"\"\" enhancers = [ (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness), (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast), (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation) ] for Enhancer, factor in enhancers: if factor != 1.0: img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor) return img ``` ### Filters and Effects Apply visual effects and filters to images: ```python from PIL import ImageFilter def apply_effects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Apply various filters and effects.\"\"\" effects = { 'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2), 'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN, 'edge': ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES, 'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS } return {name: img.filter(effect) for name, effect in effects.items()} ``` ### Drawing and Text Add text, shapes, and overlays to images: ```python from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont async def add_watermark( img: Image.Image, text: str, font_size: int = 30 ) -> Image.Image: \"\"\"Add text watermark to image.\"\"\" draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img) font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", font_size) # Calculate text size and position text_bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font) text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0] text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1] # Position text at bottom-right x = img.width - text_width - 10 y = img.height - text_height - 10 # Add text with shadow draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black') draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white') return img ``` ### Memory-Efficient Processing Handle large images without loading them entirely into memory: ```python from PIL import Image import os async def process_large_images( input_dir: str, output_dir: str, max_size: tuple[int, int] ) -> None: \"\"\"Process multiple large images efficiently.\"\"\" os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True) for filename in os.listdir(input_dir): if not filename.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')): continue input_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename) output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename) with Image.open(input_path) as img: # Process in chunks using thumbnail img.thumbnail(max_size) img.save(output_path, optimize=True) ``` Practice with these resources: - [Pillow Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/): Complete API reference - [Python Image Processing Tutorial](https://realpython.com/image-processing-with-the-python-pillow-library/): In-depth guide - [Sample Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lamsimon/celebs): Test images for practice Watch these tutorials for hands-on demonstrations: [![Image Processing Tutorial for beginners with Python PIL in 30 mins](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/dkp4wUhCwR4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/dkp4wUhCwR4) ### Image Processing with ImageMagick [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a powerful command-line tool for image manipulation, offering features beyond what's possible with Python libraries. It's particularly useful for: - Batch processing large image collections - Complex image transformations - High-quality format conversion - Creating image thumbnails - Adding text and watermarks Basic Operations: ```bash # Format conversion convert input.png output.jpg # Resize image (maintains aspect ratio) convert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg # Compress image quality convert input.jpg -quality 85 output.jpg # Rotate image convert input.jpg -rotate 90 output.jpg ``` Common Data Science Tasks: ```bash # Create thumbnails for dataset preview convert input.jpg -thumbnail 200x200^ -gravity center -extent 200x200 thumb.jpg # Normalize image for ML training convert input.jpg -normalize -strip output.jpg # Extract dominant colors convert input.jpg -colors 5 -unique-colors txt: # Generate image statistics identify -verbose input.jpg | grep -E \"Mean|Standard|Kurtosis\" ``` Batch Processing: ```bash # Convert all images in a directory mogrify -format jpg *.png # Resize multiple images mogrify -resize 800x600 -path output/ *.jpg # Add watermark to images for f in *.jpg; do convert \"$f\" -gravity southeast -draw \"text 10,10 'Copyright'\" \"watermarked/$f\" done ``` Advanced Features: ```bash # Apply image effects convert input.jpg -blur 0x3 blurred.jpg convert",

It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn't enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: - **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers - ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only - UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII - UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java - UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you'll encounter: ```python # Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() # Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') # Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding']) ``` [![Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #2 (17 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jeIBNn5Y5fI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)",

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package and project manager that's becoming the standard for running Python scripts. It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling: - **Python Version Management**: uv installs and manages _multiple_ Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly. - **Virtual Environment Handling**: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects. - **Dependency Management**: With support for the pyproject.toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv.lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems. - **Project Execution**: The `uv run` command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows. Here are some commonly used commands: ```bash # Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies. uv run script.py # Run a Python script directly from the Internet uv run https://example.com/script.py # Run a Python script without installing uvx ruff # Use a specific Python version uv run --python 3.11 script.py # Add dependencies to your script uv add httpx --script script.py # Create a virtual environment at .venv uv venv # Install packages to your virtual environment uv pip install httpx ``` Here are some useful tools you can run with `uvx` without installation: ```bash uvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab # Jupyter notebook uvx marimo # Interactive notebook uvx llm # Chat with LLMs from the command line uvx openwebui # Chat with LLMs via the browser uvx httpie # Make HTTP requests uvx datasette # Browse SQLite databases uvx markitdown # Convert PDF to Markdown uvx yt-dlp # Download YouTube videos uvx asciinema # Record your terminal and play it ``` uv uses [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) for dependencies. The eliminates the need for `requirements.txt` or virtual environments. For example: ```python # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"httpx\", # \"pandas\", # ] # /// ``` [![uv - Python package and project management | Inline Script Metadata (28 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/igWlYl3asKw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/igWlYl3asKw?t=1240)",

      "text": "## Vector Databases Vector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are: - **[chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)** - **[qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)** - **[lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)** - **[faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)** - **[milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)** - **[weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)** In addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example: - **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/vss.html). - **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec). - **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

      "text": "## Serverless hosting: Vercel Serverless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses: - A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) - A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) - A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) - A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) - A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: - You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt` - You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. - You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency. ```text fastapi ``` Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`. ```python # main.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"} ``` Add a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository. ```json { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] } ``` On the command line, run: - `npx vercel` to deploy a test version - `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production **Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them. ### Videos [![Vercel Product Walkthrough](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sPmat30SE4k/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k) [![Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8R-cetf_sZ4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)",

You can send images in a [base64 encoded format](base64-image.md), too. For example: ```bash # Download image and convert to base64 in one step IMAGE_BASE64=$(curl -s \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Correlation_coefficient.png\" | base64 -w 0) # Send to OpenAI API curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\ -d @- << EOF { \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"}, { \"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": { \"url\": \"data:image/png;base64,$IMAGE_BASE64\" } } ] } ] } EOF ```",

[![🤖 Playwright: Advanced Web Scraping in Python (14 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/biFzRHk4xpY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/biFzRHk4xpY) ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biFzRHk4xpY&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Playwright offers: - **JavaScript rendering**: Executes page scripts so you scrape only after content appears. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)) - **Headless & headed modes**: Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)) - **Auto‑waiting & retry**: Built‑in locators reduce flakiness. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators)) - **Multi‑browser support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—all from one API. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)) ### Example: Scraping a JS‑Rendered Site We’ll scrape [Quotes to Scrape (JS)](https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/)—a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple `requests` call gets only an empty shell ([quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/)). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content: ```python # /// script # dependencies = [\"playwright\"] # /// from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright def scrape_quotes(): with sync_playwright() as p: # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\". browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel=\"chrome\") page = browser.new_page() page.goto(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/\") quotes = page.query_selector_all(\".quote\") for q in quotes: text = q.query_selector(\".text\").inner_text() author = q.query_selector(\".author\").inner_text() print(f\"{text} — {author}\") browser.close() if __name__ == \"__main__\": scrape_quotes() ``` Save as `scraper.py` and run: ```bash uv run scraper.py ``` You’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes.",

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.",

You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regards",

It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

      "text": "@23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards",

One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community . I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.",

      "text": "@23f1002382 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything. Kind regards",

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” Kind regards",

      "text": "Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards",

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators. A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand , our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj , whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to: Expand functionality and evaluation models. Fix bugs and optimize workflows. Improve documentation for broader accessibility. The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all! Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared Best regards, Avinash Shrivastava",

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You",

For question 7 Sakshi6479: import openai You won’t be able to send request through openai python module, here is one example how you would make a request headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': f'Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}' } json_data = { 'model':'gpt-4o-mini', 'messages':[ { 'role':'user', 'content':'What is 2+2?' } ] } r = httpx.post('http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/chat/completions', headers = headers, json = json_data, timeout=10.0) You would need to use professor Anand’s proxy or some other api key through which request can be made. Url’s for free api keys: AI Proxy OpenAI GPT-4o · GitHub Models The way to use api’s is demonstrated in live sessions, also refer to this documentation sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs . For question 8, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s function calling feature and identify which function needs to be called and arguments to be used, we discussed in last Friday’s session on functions like order and cancel_order .

None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine. I’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable. This course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning. if somebody feels the same then Reply , Thankyou",

Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS. In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.",

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards",

Maybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y’all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course? because the model doesn’t know basic commands after telling how to do it.

For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that’s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine? For /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like “path=/data/format.md” or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like “path=show the data in format.md”? Are we concerned about what’s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done? For tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they’re flexible? Ex. “Count the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt”",

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion. It could be Wednesdays or Sundays or it might be in Arabic days or anything. So coding to precisely do something very specific is not the goal. The program has to be intelligent to do a certain type or class of tasks. We had a session introducing project. Week 3 session 1. But we will have a more hands on session on Tuesday. Kind regards",

      "text": "Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically. Kind regards",

Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before Hence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust. I just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.",

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email. Kind regards",

Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database & Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website & Transcribe audio from an MP3 file - Do you want the query’s response on an output file like A10? or as a response? I understand that these are broad problems you except us to solve, but it would be helpful to know what type of response you would require. Thanks, Trebhuvan",

It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it. Another Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages. create a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv add this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location and run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the \"data\" key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your assistance!",

This is as per the instructions provided here . But this gave me the following error: Error: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf The above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation. The only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent I’m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.

Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process. @carlton Sir, yesterday’s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly. Therefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead. I sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support.",

When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly. I have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated. I am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long. I beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback. Thank you for considering my heartfelt request. Sincerely, Rishit Jain (24F2004595)",

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

      "text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2, requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards",

      "text": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you",

The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

      "text": "@lakshaygarg654 Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ... Then the final layer of the nest ... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards",

However, I encountered multiple errors, including: json_extract : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_each : “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_extract_path_text : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8 . Thankyou",

Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order. But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.",

      "text": "QUESTION 9 I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund.

Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you.",

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially. Would it be possible to implement this change?",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.",

Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday , you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image 250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards",

We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.

The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it. After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE). To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console. inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input') textboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\") buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\") inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled')); Do not submit or save your answers.

Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end. The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm. We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins. We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight. All the best!",

      "text": "@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions.

Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Best Regards, Lakshay",

      "text": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

      "text": "Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

      "text": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed . And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even",

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed.

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form.

Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted rollnumber 23f2001390",

      "text": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",

Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach? How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc. Thanks and Regards Shalini",

Or just pull out something from your hAtSS at the last moment? “and responds with the answer to enter in the assignment.” From my understanding only those questions that are solved with a program and give an answer are to be considered… For example it states in the project that \" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: answer that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\" If you all still have not responded, then I’m honestly not sure if this is what y’all meant. Last project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague. I understand that y’all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don’t what they are doing. I understand Anand Sir is extremely busy(like really busy lol), but what are the course instructors doing?",

      "text": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s ? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it. image 1214×831 34.8 KB",

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.",

Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

      "text": "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

      "text": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed. Thank you for the learning opportunity",

Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields: IP: The IP address of the visitor. Remote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Remote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically ‘-’. Time: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this. Request: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts: (a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET. (b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/. (c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1. Status: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request. Size: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234. Referer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/ . User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes. Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net . Server: The IP address of the server. The fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (‘-’). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \\\" and not ‘-’. (This impacts 41 rows.) All data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone. Filter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23. Aggregate Data by IP: Sum the ‘Size’ field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries. Identify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded. Across all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?\" -F “file=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz” I would appreciate your clarification on whether the .gz file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead. Thank you for your time and assistance.",

      "text": "lakshaygarg654: GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. @carlton I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint. How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help. @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE. It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline. I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.",

      "text": "Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes first.py for GA1. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project! Best regards, vicky kumar @s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini my model at Vicky kumar tds",

These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right? Same answer as Q13 GA1 22f3000819: Can you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal``` One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text: au7BK3 33 H 5 lKz6y4n oQmbgoX 0 hNW3JH 68Q1u Write a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use: response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs) response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs) response.raise_for_status() response.json() [quote=\"22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029\"] The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription. For 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer. So I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation. Question —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question? Edit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster. Regards, Shivaditya",

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.",

I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other. but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things. Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course.",

      "text": "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video",

If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months.

Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team",

      "text": "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand ,",

Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.",

While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.

      "text": ": From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents —they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project",

I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart. I hope you will consider my case.

It seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. We just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses. We hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team. Thank you Lakshay",

Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.37.36 PM 1340×1132 196 KB I started it once again. Can you please reevaluate it now if it hasn’t been done yet. I actually tested it till 3rd of April and it was working fine. I don’t know what actually happened. Please do consider. Actually in the free tier there are many issues. These issues are beyond our control and I request the TDS team to please consider this issue and please consider re-evaluating it if it has not been done yet as we had put in a lot of efforts.",

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests. The app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response When POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests a. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response b. https://…/api → resulted in a 307 whereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/” The logs from Cloud Run image 982×552 133 KB As you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below). image 831×645 41.7 KB I request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.

Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable. This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job.

I believe the issue may have occurred because I had mistakenly provided an incorrect API endpoint in my earlier submission. However, my server is still actively running on Vercel https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app and the correct API endpoint is: correct api : https://tds-project-2-peach.vercel.app/api/ Everything else in the project is functioning as expected. I kindly request you to re-evaluate my submission using the correct endpoint as i am currently in my 3rd year of BTech Chemical engineering at NIT Allahabad and my placement session is coming so i don’t want to get failed in this course due to such a small mistake. Thank you for your understanding and support.",

This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments. Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link , with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed. Thank you for your support and guidance.",

Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results. No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly. Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project. I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation. I’ve spent weeks working on this project , including sleepless nights.

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end. I would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks. For your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment. I sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in. I genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation. Thank you very much for your time and understanding. api link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/ git 949×580 62.4 KB",

I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) . This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS : 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS : 1.1.1.1 , 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

      "text": "Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge. I checked and noted that this question has been asked recently. Additionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address. Thank you! 1000063856 1920×858 139 KB",

Moreover, if I omit either field from the form-data, the server returns the exact validation error mentioned in the re-evaluation report, which makes sense. Based on this behavior and the details in the shared report, I’d like to confirm: during the re-evaluation, was the request payload indeed sent with both question and file fields included in the form-data?

As per the official project instructions, our API was clearly required to handle POST requests at /api/ with multipart/form-data. Nowhere in the documentation was it mentioned that the API should handle GET requests. However, during evaluation, GET requests seem to be made to the endpoint, leading to 405 Method Not Allowed errors. These errors are expected behavior for an API that is properly built to accept only POST, exactly as per the project guidelines. Therefore, I request that the evaluation team only test using POST requests as originally instructed. Penalizing students because of unnecessary GET requests would be unfair and incorrect based on the project requirements. Please ensure that evaluation happens strictly according to the provided instructions.",

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’” } What Was Expected: The question required developing a script that: Parses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and Counts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure. It was explicitly stated that: Only key matches for XF are to be counted, not values. The file to be used was: E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json What I Did: I used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure. Here’s the actual response I got using this cURL command: curl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\ -H “accept: application/json” \\ -F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\ -F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json” API Output:{“answer”:“14602”} This indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended. What Went Wrong on API Side: The API returned a parsing error, indicating: “invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’” However: My file was valid JSON, properly parsed. The actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator. It may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash. Insight: If the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct. However, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.",

Once we validate, you will receive an email with your official scores that we will be pushing to Operations in a single update. Along with that email you will receive a discrepancy form where you can raise your issues. This will give us a consolidated view of problems and fix them. Kindly wait for the email to come to you. It will be sent sometime this afternoon. Kind regards, TDS Team",

I’m Vicky Kumar , a student from the Data Science and Applications program at IIT Madras . Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called “Vicky App” — a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS, . The system is capable of: Accurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching Dynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input Processing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON Delivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM You can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech What’s in it for students: They type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically Especially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload I’ve made it free for the first 3 questions After that, students can access the full platform for just ₹199/month , which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs My Humble Request: This is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students. To sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial. I would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement. It’s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students — with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter. Thank you so much for your time and support. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras npdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219 Portfolio | LinkedIn It’s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program — not to replace learning, but to accelerate it. Please let me know if you’d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise. Warm regards, Vicky Kumar B.S.

The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question) Also, my question 4 was : As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards",

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay",

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards",

This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).

This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 . Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Bug fixes If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros. Kind regards, TDS Team",

I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the os library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.” I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation. If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm. Kind regards",

I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures. Thanks and Regards",

Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks? image 302×252 3.45 KB I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail. So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py . Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code. Thank you",

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions ( pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3 ) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub ( santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest ). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!",

I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us..com:80 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us..com:80 ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy} ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy} This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup.. So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues.. Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help",

      "text": "@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 —since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj",

At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation.

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post… Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating . Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

      "text": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton . It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really!

As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

I had included the Dockerfile as required. I also added the MIT License to the project. For your reference, I am also attaching a snapshot of the repository as it was during the submission time. Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a concrete reason for giving zero marks .

      "text": "Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone cd I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email= --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!\"",

Thats why you have no logs. 90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo. The specific error in your case is: tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists Thats why there are no logs. Kind regards",

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards",

I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy. Thank you for your time and understanding.",

However, in my project directory, the main.py file is located in the app/ folder, and the run.py file is in the root folder of the project, which is LLM_Automation_Agent . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py . To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py . I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder ( llm-automation-agent ).

However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx , this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected. For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.",

At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended. Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513 805×197 9.52 KB Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent . Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter. Thank You and Regards, 24ds3000090",

Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. image 1027×510 11 KB Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

Post that realised we have cloud based \"docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches, Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..

You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # \"requests\", # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.… That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.

This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’). While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely. I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future. So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Warm regards, S.

Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards",

However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.",

There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V. Upadhyay",

I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir. Best regards, Akshit Mittal",

      "text": "Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks. Thank you once again for your understanding.",

      "text": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17",

Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I’m only concerned about my own marks , and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term. Thank you for your time and understanding. @carlton @Jivraj",

However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.",

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us. Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these",

I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning. Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.",

It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. Regards Karthik",

      "text": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.",

While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy. Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators. Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.",

The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : ) Please correct me if I am wrong",

      "text": "Hi @carlton and @Jivraj sir, I appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers. I have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows: 1000042547 1080×578 187 KB Question 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays” To filter such logs, we need: Time → for the hour and the day (Monday) Method → to filter POST URL → to filter /images/ So, the correct minimal set is: Time, Method, URL Time → needed Method → needed URL → needed Referer → not needed, but not harmful So this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it. 1000042548 1080×301 71.5 KB Acc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid: Status is numeric (200) Method (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct All required fields are present and properly formatted The other options were as follows: 9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID) 9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric) 9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827 1000042545 1079×468 35.7 KB Correct Answer(s): PUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result. GET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result. DELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted). Incorrect Answer: POST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state. (This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved) Thank you",

The question mentions that a list filtered_entries is being created , and with the way the question is structured it seems like the filtering conditions mentioned in the question have already been applied. In that case len(filtered entries) seems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ . image 1108×394 81.9 KB The valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct. Also, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct. Request you to please clarify and consider these points.",

      "text": "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons: Redundancy in Option A: The Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary. Simplicity in Filtering: Filtering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using: Time → for checking the hour and weekday. Method → to filter only POST. URL → to ensure the request is under /images/. Thus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant. Consistency with Log Parsing Practices: In most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.",
